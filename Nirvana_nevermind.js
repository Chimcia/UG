        "body":"Nevermind is the second studio album by American rock band Nirvana, released on September 24, 1991 by DGC Records. Produced by Butch Vig, it was the band's first release on the label, as well as the first to feature drummer Dave Grohl. Nevermind was responsible in part for bringing both alternative rock and grunge music to a mainstream audience, and has been ranked highly on lists of the greatest albums of all time by publications such as Rolling Stone and Time. The Recording Industry Association of America later certified the album Diamond (at least 10 million copies shipped), and it has sold at least 30 million copies worldwide, with 10.6 million sold in the United States alone.",
